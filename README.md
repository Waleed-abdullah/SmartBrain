# SmartBrain
This project was created using create-react-app, a backend server with node and express and a database using postgreSQL
It uses a Clarifai machine learning api to detect faces, just paste an image address into the textbox to make it detect the image.

The backend API can be found here: https://github.com/Waleed-abdullah/SmartBrainAPI
